# Elemental Selenium Tips

Here are all of the code examples from [the Elemental Selenium Tip Archives](http://elementalselenium.com/tips).

They're currently only available in Ruby. But for each one that gets converted to a new programming language, I'll do a full write-up for it.

To submit your entry:

1. Fork the repo
2. Choose a tip to port
3. Add a folder to it for the language you want (e.g., `javascript`, `java`, `csharp`, `php`, `python`, etc.)
4. Write the code example
5. Submit a pull request


Happy Testing!
